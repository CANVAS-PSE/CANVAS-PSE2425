# Contributing to CANVAS

Welcome to `CANVAS`:sun_with_face:! We're thrilled that you're interested in contributing to our open-source project :fire:.
By participating, you can help improve the project and make it even better :raised_hands:.

## How to Contribute

1. **Clone the repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using Git :octocat::

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ARTIST-Association/CANVAS.git
   ```

2. **Install all development dependencies** in a separate python virtual environment from the main branch of your repo.
   This will put a number of pre-commit hooks, for code linting and code style for both Python and JavaScript, into place.
   It will also install tools like ruff and ESLint, used for development.
   Till we completely merged to a pyproject.toml you need to run the following commands:

   ```bash
   # Python environment
   python3 -m venv <insert/path/to/your/venv>
   source <insert/path/to/your/venv/bin/activate>

   # Pre commit hooks
   pre-commit install

   # Dev tools
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   npm install
   ```

3. **Open a new issue or choose an existing one**: When opening a new issue choose a fitting label. Assign yourself to the chosen or new issue.
   If the issue is bigger, feel free to create a task list, and even new sub-issues.
